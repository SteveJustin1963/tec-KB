- The first generation TEC-1's by now have an apealing dirty, faded and cracked patina on the SPST Momentary PCB Mount Tactile Switchs
- 40 years later new ones can still be had from Altronics. 
- New TEC-1's ar sporting coloured square key tops with clear plastic covers. 
- Issue 15 said; "The LCD will be supported further in issue 16 and if all goes well, we will have a cheap, full alpha-numeric keyboard with supporting software". Follwing this up with Colin Mitchell (2019) albiet very late he said, "I can't remember what they were going to use, 15 years ago. You can buy a keyboard for $12.00". He is right, uing a modern KB is cheaper than a DIY one, but not as fun! I dont like using usb on the tec1, and ps2 type kb is better but still needs decoding.  



- How about a Blackberry Q10 kb? lets try it out. getting the bits...
- get a bbq10kbd_breakout pcb

### Iterate
- review current tec-1 kb design, code and operation
- review FB group chats, eg changed code reflect new key positions 
- expand current kb system with a few additional parts on the 74c928 
  - https://easyeda.com/editor#id=f7c6e0caf9ca4567a0e26ea7a1748cf3

- can another kb project be ported to the tec-1? eg RS2014 
- can the mini qwerty layout be used such as the Blackberry Q10 ?
- what if no more 74c923 chips?
- parallel ascii kb
- ps2 kb with asci decoder
