## Introduction 
The first TEC-1's now have dirty, cracked and faded patina apeal that used the SPST Momentary PCB Mount Tactile Switch, new ones can be had from Altronics. 
New TEC-1's have either the original or square keys with clear plastic covers. Now exploring new designs; the magazine issue 15 said; "The LCD will be supported further in issue 16 and if all goes well, we will have a cheap, full alpha-numeric keyboard with supporting software". Asking Colin Mitchell (2019); "I can't remember what they were going to use, 15 years ago. You can [now] buy a keyboard for $12.00". He is right, trying a modern KB with various interfaces is cheaper than DIY, but not necessarily easier.

## Literature Review


## Observe and Question 
* review current tec-1 kb design, code and operation
* review FB group chats, eg changed code reflect new key positions 
* http://www.keyboard-layout-editor.com/
* rearrange and or expand the current kb with a few additional parts
* can another kb project be ported to the tec-1?
* can the mini qwerty layout be used such as the Blackberry Q10 ?


## Theory - Testable
Try the Q10

## Prediction

## Method 
design additonal circuit, build a mini interface for the Q10, hack some new code

74C923 alternatives, "Just scan them with an 8 bit input and 8 bit output latch. You are already scanning the 7seg display. there is the output scan already done for you. You will notice there is a header at the bottom of the 1E labeled Scan 7-0. That is there for this exact reason." (Ken Stone 2019)
