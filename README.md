## Introduction 
The tec-1 enjoys a proud frugal kb that achieves a lot with so little. The fact that its home hacked and often falling apart with its dirty key tops adds to its retro patina appeal. Any use of weird key switches and cheap plastic shapes all the better. Now to explore and explore and expand this design/

## Observe and Question 
* review current tec-1 kb design and its code in various roms
* review FB group chats, eg changed code reflect new key positions, eg BG
* rearrange and or expand the current kb with little additional parts ?
* can a mini qwerty layout be achieved
* can another kb project be ported to the tec-1?
* in issue 15, "The LCD will be supported further in issue 16 and if all goes well, we will have a cheap, full alpha-numeric keyboard with supporting software". 
* "I can't remember what they were going to use, 15 years ago. You can [now] buy a keyboard for $12.00" (Colin Mitchell 2019)
* look at a ps/2, usb, bluetooth  kb, it's cheaper to buy kb than make one.

"Ken Stone; Just scan them with an 8 bit input and 8 bit output latch. You are already scanning the 7seg display. there is the output scan already done for you. You will notice there is a header at the bottom of the 1E labeled Scan 7-0. That is there for this exact reason."
